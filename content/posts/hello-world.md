## Introduction

Hi everyone, I'm Dan!

I've been finding myself drift away from the hands-on technical work I used to love. Specifically, I've noticed my practical coding skills are getting rusty, and I'm losing touch with the cutting-edge developments in the open-source Speech AI space.

This blog is my commitment to changing that. It's a personal challenge to **get my hands dirty again**, dive back into the code, and document every technical victory (and failure!) along the way.

Consider this my accountability partner and technical journal. **Stay tuned~!**
